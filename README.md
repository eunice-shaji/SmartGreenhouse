#  Smart Greenhouse – Monitoring System  
A .NET MAUI Application

The *Smart Greenhouse – Monitoring System* is a cross-platform .NET MAUI application that simulates real-time monitoring and control of a greenhouse environment.  
The app displays dynamic sensor values such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, and includes actuator controls for a fan and water pump.  
The project also demonstrates integrated MAUI native features and a basic security mechanism.


##  Features

###  Real-Time Sensor Simulation
- Automatically updating temperature, humidity, and soil moisture values  
- Simulated through a built-in timer  
- Clean dashboard layout for easy visibility

###  Actuator Control
- Toggle ON/OFF buttons for:
  - Fan  
  - Water pump  
- UI updates instantly to reflect actuator status

###  Security Feature
- The login screen restricts access to the main application  
- User credentials (or session tokens) stored using *SecureStorage*, a native MAUI feature

###  Native Feature Integration
- Uses *SecureStorage* to manage sensitive data securely  
- Demonstrates how MAUI interacts with device-level capabilities

###  Cross-Platform Support
- Runs on *Windows, **Android, and **macOS* (if enabled)  
- Responsive UI built with MAUI XAML pages


##  Technology Stack

- *Framework:* .NET MAUI  
- *Language:* C#  
- *UI:* XAML pages with MVVM 
- *Data:* Local in-app simulation  
- *Native Integration:* SecureStorage

##  How to Build and Run the Project

Follow the steps below to set up, build, and run the Smart Greenhouse application.

---

### 1. Install Required Software

You must install:

1. *Visual Studio 2022* (latest version)  
2. Required workloads:
   -  *.NET Multi-platform App UI development*
3. The correct *.NET SDK* version (e.g., .NET 8)

---

### 2. Get the Project Code

Clone the repository:

`bash
(https://github.com/aaroie/SmartGreenhouse-1.git))

----

3. Open the Solution in Visual Studio

-Open Visual Studio 2022
-Select File → Open → Project/Solution…
-Choose the solution file: SmartGreenhouse.sln
-Let Visual Studio restore NuGet packages automatically.

---

4. Build the Application

-Right-click the solution → Set Startup Project → select the main MAUI app
-At the top toolbar, choose your target: Windows Machine (WinUI) — easiest for testing
-Go to Build → Build Solution
-Ensure the build completes with no errors.

----

5. Run the Application
-Click the Start button
-The Smart Greenhouse app will launch
-Navigate the app to test:

App Sections:

* Login Page:

-Enter username and password
-Credentials validated inside the app
-SecureStorage stores session state securely

* Dashboard:

-Displays dynamic simulated values:
                                   Temperature
                                   Humidity
                                   Soil Moisture
-Values update automatically on a timer

* Controls
-Toggle the Fan and Water Pump
-App updates the actuator state visually
